# SLU-App
## App Description
Typically when tourist visit Saint Lucia, they have to rely on word of mouth to find out about the gems of the island that may not be as popular. Thus, I have created an app that features some of the islands most stunning attractions along with a map view with pinpoint annotations showing their locations. Along with the map view is a short description on the site and what can be expected if one decides to visit. 

## Tools and Feautures
- Use of Swift 5 to develop a single view iOS application with multiple navigation views 
- Horizontal scroll view feature used to display all data populated by JSON file
- Use of iOS Maps SDK to create in-app Map view to avoid redirection to other map apps. 
- Use of swift 5 styling features to design each navigation view with transition animations and font styling
